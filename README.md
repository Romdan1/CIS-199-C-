C# Programming Projects
This repository showcases the work I completed during my sophomore year of college while learning the fundamentals of C#. Through this course, I gained hands-on experience with:

Basic syntax and data types

Loops and nested loops

Conditional statements

Functions and methods

Simple C# applications

One of my key projects was building a calculator application, which helped solidify my understanding of logic, user input, and control flow in C#. These projects laid a strong foundation in programming and sparked my continued interest in software development.
